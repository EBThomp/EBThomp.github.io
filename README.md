So why **_did_** I choose Computer Science as my degree? Simply put, I like solving puzzles. I like breaking things and figuring out how to put them back together. Like this website. I broke it before and I'll probably break it again. But I **_will_** find a way <sup>or make a way</sup> to fix it. I'm stubborn as well as creative.
